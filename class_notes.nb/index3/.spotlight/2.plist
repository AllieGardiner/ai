	<string>Chapter 1 Homework 1:4 - For Turing's machine to be considered intelligent, it only had to mimic human behavior in conversation.  In fact, it would need to conceal its ability to perform tasks that computers excel at, like complex calculations, in order to appear human.  Mimicry alone does not make something intelligent. 1:5 - For a computer to be intelligent, it must produce original thoughts.  It needs to be creative in solving problems.  It must be able to learn from its past performance, and apply that knowledge to future interactions.  Ultimately, it should be useful to us.  An intelligent computer program is only really intelligent if it can solve the problems we give it. 1:7 - Since nature is has produced the only intelligent creatures we're aware of, it makes sense to study those natural phenomena in order to recreate them in software.  While computers have very different architecture than the human brain, they may be able to model the way the human brain works, and the interaction of neurons, and through this modeling, display the same type of emergent behavior as our brains cells (that is, intelligence).  It should be easier to model the behavior of a neuron, then multiply it by a billion, than to come up with some other abstract model of intelligence. 1:10 - I think that human and animal learning is not very well understood, and so trying to come up with methods of machine learning is difficult.  How do we make certain connections between different pieces of knowledge in order to come up with an understanding of a larger concept?  I think that machine learning will improve once we understand more about how our own learning works. 1:11 - I think that computers  could be created to understand natural languages.  Already, they're pretty good at understanding speech, although they don't understand the meaning of it.  I can talk into my phone to perform a Google search, but my phone has no knowledge of what I'm looking for.  I think simple, natural language interactions with computers are not too far off.  Usually, we interact with computers to perform some task, and so most of our verbal interactions with computers would come in the form of commands.  Simple commands should be easier to understand than a complex discussion about philosophy.  As the book notes, to understand natural language, you need context about whatever it is you want to discuss.  For computers to really excel at natural language communication, they must also have a deep knowledge about the world. </string>
