	<string>Human Language Processing / Understanding What would constitute AI level language processing? Early Attempts dictionary grammar for disambiguation Not very effective Stochastic correlation identify contextual relationships to remove ambiguity Linguistics the study of languages areas of study semantics - meaning syntactics - grammar / structure pragmatics - how language is used in practice, purposes for using language phonetics - spoken language semeiotics - written language lexical - dictionary, set of words in a language Which areas will help us with human language processing? semantics - use dictionary to get meaning of words syntactics - grammar Pragmatics - how is language used Convey information Social Entertainment Propaganda - Misinformation Knowledge Representation &lt;--&gt; mappings &lt;--&gt; Human Language Better Knowledge Representations Schank conceptual dependencies Schank's scripts Written vs Spoken language text recognition is easier to decipher Ray Kurzweil developed Kurzweil reader in the 1970's Omni-font character recognition speech recognition is harder Disambiguation Human language is inherently ambiguous Methods of disambiguation Grammar Transition Networks Recursive Transition Networks Context Free Grammars only Augmented Transition Networks RTN with parameters and procedural attachment to branches of network parameters usually tense, object, etc. Methods to process language without using grammar Stochastic analysis effective inefficient proximity of word to other words of interest provides context probably represents how we recognize context in language nouns give you most context could provide a contextual significance level to every word in dictionary - nouns at top, articles at bottom way to reduce complexity of analysis Non-Contextual Word Frequencies different authors use non-contextual words differently it is possible to determine authorship base on non-contextual word frequency Multi-level - how does AI helps us to process language? Every level feedback into sublevels World knowledge - scripts (common experience) Meanings - phrase &amp; sentences Word disambiguation - syntactic or Stochastic Lexical - word identifiication Character recognition Voice recognition Natural Language Applications Telephone user interface User front ends database search engine Language translation help Terrorist newswire listener Resources www.aaai.org AI Topics search for NLP </string>
